If you are a current MSOE student, faculty, or staff member, you can request access to gain credentials for Rosie.  

Please note that requesting access does not guarantee that your request will be approved.  You will need to describe a legitimate need to utilize Rosie to be granted access.  

Uploading proprietary data is only allowed with explicit permission of the system administrator and the owner of the data.  

Once your access is approved, any use of Rosie that doesn't align with MSOE's academic mission may result in removal of your access credentials and disciplinary action through the dean of students office depending on severity.
